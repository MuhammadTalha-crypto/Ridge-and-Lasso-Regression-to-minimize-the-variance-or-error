# Ridge-and-Lasso-Regression-to-minimize-the-variance-or-error
In this project, we will use ridge and lasso regression models to add a penalty to the cost function of the linear regression model. As the result the slop of the trained model line will change to minimize the variance and hence the Error. This will increase the model accuracy.
